Your Name: [Your Name]
Date: [Submission Date]
SDG Alignment: SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-being)

Slide 2: Problem Statement
Current Challenges in Taekwondo Training:

Athletes struggle to track belt progression digitally.

Coaches lack tools to monitor student progress remotely.

No centralized platform for competitions/training resources.

Statistic:

*"60% of martial arts schools still use paper-based belt testing systems."*

Slide 3: Solution
Sport World Taekwondo App:

"A Flutter app providing real-time belt tracking, training videos, and competition updates for athletes and coaches."

Athletes: Ages 8-35, from white to black belts.

Coaches: Manage dojos/students digitally.

Fans: Follow competitions.

Market Size:

*80M+ taekwondo practitioners worldwide (World Taekwondo Federation, 2023).*

Slide 5: Technology Stack
Frontend: Flutter (iOS/Android)
Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore)
APIs: World Taekwondo Federation (event data)
AI: Pose detection for form correction (future)

Include Flutter + Firebase logos.

Slide 6: Competitive Advantage
Why Our App Stands Out:

ðŸ¥‡ All-in-one platform (vs. separate apps for training/events).

ðŸ“´ Offline mode for dojos with poor internet.

ðŸŽ® Gamified learning (badges for belt skills).
