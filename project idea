Sport World Taekwondo App – Project Idea
What’s the Problem?
Taekwondo athletes and coaches still rely on:

Paper logbooks to track belt progress 🗒️

Disorganized YouTube videos for training 🎥

Word-of-mouth for competition updates 📣

This makes training less efficient and harder to scale.

Our Solution
A mobile app built with Flutter that:

Tracks belt progression digitally (like Duolingo for Taekwondo belts).

Curates training videos (kicks, forms, drills) in one place.

Sends alerts for local competitions and results.

Who Will Use It?
Athletes: See their next skills to master for each belt.

Coaches: Monitor students’ progress remotely.

Parents: Track their kids’ achievements.

Tech We’ll Use
Flutter: To build for both iOS and Android.

Firebase: For user accounts and data storage.

Simple UI: Easy navigation for all ages.

What Makes It Unique?
🥋 Made by martial artists, for martial artists (unlike generic fitness apps).

📱 Works offline (for dojos with bad internet).

🎯 Skill checklists to prepare for belt tests.

Future Possibilities
AI to analyze kicks via phone camera.

Virtual sparring matchups with other dojos.

Why This Matters
Taekwondo is about discipline and growth – this app helps athletes train smarter while preserving the art’s traditions.

Next Steps
Build a basic version with belt tracking.

Test it with our local dojo.

Expand features based on feedback.

This version keeps it clear and actionable while avoiding pitch deck formality. Want to focus on a specific part? For example:

“How would the belt tracking work technically?”

“What’s the simplest version we could build first?”
